Confidentiality of data is done by encryption. Operating systems have access controls that allow system users to be identified(username), authenticated (password) and authorised (file access permissions). Integrity of data means that the information is accurate, complete and cannot be changed without authorisation. Hashing provides a way to check the integrity of digital files. A \u2018hash\u2019 is a number produced by applying a hashing algorithm to the file. Digital signatures and certificates provide assurance that a communication is from the correct person. In database systems, the normalisation process used at the design stage is used to help ensure data is not duplicated. Out of date or inaccurate information can have an impact on the integrity of a database. Non-repudiation is assuring that something cannot be denied. Digital signatures can provide non-repudiation, as do operating system features such as audit logs, which show what particular user accessed a file and when. Availability. An organisation must decide what level of availability it needs for its computer systems. In order to increase the availability of a system, an organisation has to remove any single point of failure from the system. \u200bThey can achieve this through a number of methods: Disc redundancy \u2013 using multiple discs so that the system continues uninterrupted if one fails.\u200b Backup \u2013 to replace any data lost due, for example, to corruption or human error. Server redundancy \u2013 duplicated hardware in case of a serious hardware failure.\u200b Disaster recovery \u2013 putting plans in place to run the whole system from a different location in the case of a physical disaster such as fire or flood. Companies need to have considered what level of access can be given to specific users or groups. Ideally, each user only has access to the data that they actually require for doing their job. \u200bThis provides minimal access to information - lowest required access permission - to maximise the protection of the data. \u200bMost systems allow various levels of access: \u200bFull access \u2013 ability to read, write and delete files\u200b Write access \u2013 ability to read and write files but not delete them\u200b Read access \u2013 ability only to view files. The system should protect the data from unauthorised access or modification of information, from theft and from any type of loss. Furthermore, an organisation should know how long it can survive without its systems in the case of hardware failure or a disaster such as a fire or flood. The Freedom of Information Act is a piece of legislation that grants public access to documents or other data in the possession of a government agency or public authority, unless the information falls into a category that is specifically excluded from the terms of the legislation. It is imperative that those who need access to information have it, in order to keep the data useful. Systems managers should make sure that the correct people have access to the right information and only that information. It is also important that the data is kept correct. Any incorrect data can potentially cause devastating effects. It can damage someone's reputation or cause mistakes in the system. If this happens complaints can be made and such errors can bring down a business. The Data Protection Act 2018 ensures that personal data is used appropriately. Only the necessary personal information should only be used with specified reasons for no longer than needed and it should always be kept up to date. Under this act the right to ask anyone about the data they hold on yourself is given. The Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 protects any artist or creators from having their original work stolen. The work has to be material, as just ideas and concepts are not protected. The law rewards artists and creators for publishing their original work. They can earn money from it and also control what happens to it like reproduction. Copyright Infringement is the act of breaking the agreements of this law. Creators can give out a \u201clicence to use\u201d. This allows the given company or person to use the creator's work without consequence, however sometimes for a form of compensation. If ownership is given out this is non-exclusive but if it isn\u2019t this is exclusive. The typical copyright duration is 70 years after the last owner of the work passes. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 prevents people from making and/or owning anything which can be used in computer misuse offences. It keeps data safe from unauthorised editing and makes accessing computer systems and data illegal if no permission is given. If any of these things are breached fines and penalties can be given. The Fraud Act 2006 outlines the basis of fraud. This was put in place due to flaws in the previous act (The Theft Act 1968 and 78). It added a new offence which is now known in three ways. Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice) (Interception of Communications) Regulations 2000 give businesses the right to monitor communications on their own networks. Previously such interception would have been unlawful unless consent had been given by both the sender and the recipient.","title":"Notes"},{"location":"notes/notes/#principles-of-data-security","text":"Confidentiality is the principle that information should not be disclosed or accessible to anyone who isn't authorised.

The motherboard/logic board connects the hardware components for example the CPU and RAM. Being the biggest circuit, a motherboard can be found in the computer case. They come in many different shapes and sizes to suit different needs. Central Processing Unit (CPU). A CPU, also known as the brain of the computer, performs a wide number of actions within the device. Near enough all devices contain a CPU as they are necessary for processing and completing commands. It is located in the Motherboard where everything you do sends a message through to it. They can come in different speeds which are measured in MegaHertz and GigaHertz (MHz or GHz). Most commonly they are found at 500MHz to 800MHz and more modern computers have two. Random Access Memory (RAM). RAM is the computer's main stored temporary memory. Allowing the processor to find this quicker than long term memory keeps the data very easily accessible. It is located in the motherboard and can have many different capacities (8GB to 64GB) doubling each time. The higher RAM is most essential for things such as gaming. Power Supply. The Power Supply Unit provides electricity to all of the necessary components. It can change its current from direct to alternating for the internal components. Hard Disk Drive (HDD). A hard disk/hard drive is used for storing data. It is counted in a magnetic material which allows it to read and write data as it rotates. It can then store the digital data. Data Cables. These cables carry a binary electrical signal and are essential in providing connectivity between the computer's components. They can also pass data through hard drives to give information to another device. Graphics Card. Graphic Cards are expansion cards that are added in order to improve the quality the screen provides on a computer making its display appear more high definition. Network Interface Card (NIC). The network card is the component that connects the computer to a computer network and controls the data on a network. Data from the CPU is sent to the NIC which the NIC then takes and sends to another destination. Sound Card. The sound card is responsible for the input and output of audio signals. It is not necessary but is included in almost all computers. It sends information to audio components such as speakers to produce sound for things like movies. Fan. There are many different types of fans in a computer for multiple components and places. They circulate air around the given area, cooling it down. This prevents overheating components which can cause damage. SSD. A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a device used for storage and is used to replace a hard disk due to it being much faster and quieter. They also have low latency and high input and output rates. External components of a computer: Keyboard. Keyboards are used to input data into the device (letters, numbers, symbols). Mouse. A mouse is used to navigate the monitor and interact with the objects found on it. Microphone. A microphone is used to capture audio content and store it onto the device or is used for conversation. Scanner. This is a device which copies data from a hard copy by scanning it and provides a digital copy. Printer. This produces data (photos, numbers, letters) onto a hard copy (paper). Plotters. Plotters are similar to printers however output data more accurately using instructions. These are usually more expensive. Camera. Akin to a microphone, this is used to capture images and or videos and store them in the used device. Disc Unit. This extracts data from floppy, digital and compact discs.
