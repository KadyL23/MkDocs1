# Components of a Computer
---

A computer is “an electronic device for storing and processing data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.” Computers are full of both internal and external components:

## Internal components of a computer:

Motherboard.
The motherboard/logic board connects the hardware components for example the CPU and
RAM.  Being the biggest circuit, a motherboard can be found in the computer case. They come in many different shapes and sizes to suit different needs.

Central Processing Unit (CPU). 
A CPU, also known as the brain of the computer, performs a wide number of actions within the device. Near enough all devices contain a CPU as they are necessary for processing and completing commands. It is located in the Motherboard where everything you do sends a message through to it. They can come in different speeds which are measured in MegaHertz and GigaHertz (MHz or GHz). Most commonly they are found at 500MHz to 800MHz and more modern computers have two.

Random Access Memory (RAM).
RAM is the computer's main stored temporary memory. Allowing the processor to find this quicker than long term memory keeps the data very easily accessible. It is located in the motherboard and can have many different capacities (8GB to 64GB) doubling each time. The higher RAM is most essential for things such as gaming.

Power Supply.
The Power Supply Unit provides electricity to all of the necessary components. It can change its current from direct to alternating for the internal components. 

Hard Disk Drive (HDD).
A hard disk/hard drive is used for storing data. It is counted in a magnetic material which allows it to read and write data as it rotates. It can then store the digital data.

Data Cables.
These cables carry a binary electrical signal and are essential in providing connectivity between the computer's components. They can also pass data through hard drives to give information to another device. 

Graphics Card.
Graphic Cards are expansion cards that are added in order to improve the quality the screen provides on a computer making its display appear more high definition. 

Network Interface Card (NIC).
The network card is the component that connects the computer to a computer network and controls the data on a network. Data from the CPU is sent to the NIC which the NIC then takes and sends to another destination.

Sound Card.
The sound card is responsible for the input and output of audio signals. It is not necessary but is included in almost all computers. It sends information to audio components such as speakers to produce sound for things like movies.

Fan.
There are many different types of fans in a computer for multiple components and places. They circulate air around the given area, cooling it down. This prevents overheating components which can cause damage.

SSD.
A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a device used for storage and is used to replace a hard disk due to it being much faster and quieter. They also have low latency and high input and output rates.

## External components of a computer:

Keyboard.
Keyboards are used to input data into the device (letters, numbers, symbols).

Mouse.
A mouse is used to navigate the monitor and interact with the objects found on it.


Microphone.
A microphone is used to capture audio content and store it onto the device or is used for conversation.

Scanner.
This is a device which copies data from a hard copy by scanning it and provides a digital copy.

Printer.
This produces data (photos, numbers, letters) onto a hard copy (paper).

Plotters.
Plotters are similar to printers however output data more accurately using instructions. These are usually more expensive.

Camera.
Akin to a microphone, this is used to capture images and or videos and store them in the used device.

Disc Unit.
This extracts data from floppy, digital and compact discs.

ESD - Electrostatic discharge 

## Inputs:

Nonessential - Microphone - converts analogue to digital - aux cable, 3.5mm audio jack 

Essential - Keyboard - input text characters - QWERTY, DVORAK - USB, wireless

Useful - Mouse - navigates cursors, pointers, icons - x,y coordinates - mechanical, optical

Nonessential - Webcam - capture real time images

Nonessential - sensor - optical - environmental (temp) biometric (fingerprint) - captures data

Nonessential - scanner - flatbed, 3D, barcode - medical, building

## Outputs:

Essential - Screen/monitor (RGB) - Light Emitting Diode, Plasma, Liquid Crystal Display, Cathode Ray Tubes - outputs images to screens

Speakers - converts digital into analogue sounds - aux audio jack, wireless

Printers (CMYK-black) - converts digital data to hard data - 3D, inkjet, laser-powder/toner

Plotter - pen, lines - graphs, vector images


Factors that affect the choice of components:

Compatibility - the components need to be compatible with one another, for example, some components only work with specific operating systems

Form factor - the components need to fit perfectly in its places to function correctly

Cost - component’s prices can vary depending on the store it’s from or how it performs so it's best to check multiple stores for the nicer prices before purchasing 

User - every user has their own preferences for their components, for example, some may want to customise them

Performance - components perform differently for different things so the components should be chosen correctly to achieve the best performance, for example, gamers may want better working graphics cards than someone who uses their computer for work only

Future proof - checking how long the components will last is very important so that nothing unexpectedly breaks earlier than planned causing a variety of issues

Availability - you need to ensure the components are available to get before planning ahead, because, if one component isn't, it could mean all the other components need to change
